# Connect4Lua

An Implementation of Connect Four in Lua using LOVE framework for graphics.

## Play

To test the code and play, just clone the directory and outside of it run the command: *love Connect4Lua*.

## NOTE
The game has 2 player: a randomic generator (silly pc), and the AI that uses  Minimax algorithm to choose the move.

I apologize for the comments in Italian but the game was also used for a university project.

### Thanks to:
@FedeMinetti and @Mattia22 for developing the graphics.
